<h3>Washington LD KML Files</h3>
<p>There is a KML file for each legislative district, named vt53_&lt;n&gt;.kml, where
<em><strong>n</strong></em> is the LD number. Each file contains shapes for all 
precincts in the LD, including split precincts partially in the LD, colored with 
11 different colors, ordered alphabetically. The overall LD shape with no fill 
is also included. Each precinct lists the total population and voter age 
population (VAP).<br />
<br />
The KMLs work well in Google Earth (download at
<a href="http://earth.google.com">http://earth.google.com</a>). They can be 
loaded in Google Maps, but because there are so many polygons, Google Maps will 
divide the polygons into 4 to 10 sections, so you cannot view them all at once.<br />
<br />
All of these were produced by a tool I authored. Inputs are<br />
- Precinct shapefiles (from Census 2010)<br />
- Precinct population info (from Census 2010)<br />
- Census block to precinct mapping info (from Census 2010)<br />
- Block equivalency file (FINALLEG2011.txt) (from the state redistricting 
commission)<br />
- LD District KML (FINAL_LEGISLATIVE_PLAN_2011.kmz) (from the state 
redistricting commission)<br />
The tool also reduces the polygon complexity somewhat using the Douglas-Peucker 
algorithm.<br />
<br />
Please contact me with questions or comments. Thanks.</p>
